# Global Warming: Fact or Fiction? using R
We will analyse data about a temperature in Adelaide. The data was collected by Australian Bureau of Meteorology â€“ the best source of the climate related information in Australia (http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/data/index.shtml?bookmark=200).
Two presented data set contain information about daily maximal and minimal temperatures for Adelaide weather station 023034 at Adelaide Airport. You can think about them as the highest temperature during the day and the lowest temperature during the night. This is not 100% correct but it is close enough.

You get a chance to say your own word on the question of climate change based on the hard-core
facts from a rigorous data analysis. Make a function to calculate and (nicely) present descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, skewness, kurtosis, median, IQR) for any given month and year. Run this function for a maximal temperature for any selected month of 1961 and 2021. Compare results and discuss if climate changed over the last 50 years. Present appropriate data visualisation to support your discussion.

Combine two data sets together and calculate a daily range between maximal and minimal temperature. Discuss its distribution and change over the time. Provide
appropriate data visualisation to support your discussion.

Do the following steps:
a. Count number of days per year with maximal temperature equal or above 35 degrees. Build a graph. Discuss your observations.
b. Select and justify a threshold for a minimal temperature and repeat step (a) for the number of days below the chosen threshold. Discuss your observations.
c. Combine results from steps (a) and (b); discuss your finding and implications for the question of climate change.
